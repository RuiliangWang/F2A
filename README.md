# F2A
F2A is an aero-hydro-servo-elastic tool developed by Yang Yang (PDRA in LJMU) based on AQWA for performing fully coupled analysis of floating offshore wind turbines. The aero-servo-elastic simulation capabilities are fully implemented within the user_force64.dll which is a built-in DLL of AQWA for external force calculation.
